  - 4 Pomodoros = 2 hours

- **11:00-12:00 PM**: Review & consolidation
  - Quick review of morning learning
  - Take notes, create mind maps
  - Plan afternoon sessions

### Afternoon Block (1:00 PM - 6:00 PM)
**Moderate cognitive performance**

- **1:00-2:30 PM**: Practical Application
  - Hands-on projects, coding practice
  - Apply morning theoretical learning
  - 3 Pomodoros = 1.5 hours

- **2:30-3:00 PM**: Break & light snack
- **3:00-4:30 PM**: Interactive Learning
  - Group discussions, online courses
  - Video tutorials, podcasts
  - 3 Pomodoros = 1.5 hours

- **4:30-5:00 PM**: Break
- **5:00-6:00 PM**: Skills Development
  - Language learning, soft skills
  - Creative projects, writing
  - 2 Pomodoros = 1 hour

### Evening Block (7:00 PM - 10:00 PM)
**Review and light learning**

- **7:00-8:00 PM**: Review Session
  - Flashcards, quick revision
  - Test yourself on day's learning
  - 2 Pomodoros = 1 hour

- **8:00-9:00 PM**: Relaxed Learning
  - Reading, documentaries
  - Podcasts, audiobooks
  - Low-pressure knowledge absorption

- **9:00-10:00 PM**: Planning & Reflection
  - Review day's progress
  - Plan tomorrow's learning goals
  - Journal insights and challenges

**Total Daily Learning Time: 8-9 hours**
